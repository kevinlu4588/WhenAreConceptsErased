## Overview

In concept erasure, a model is modified to selectively prevent it from generating a target concept. Despite the rapid development of new methods, it remains unclear how thoroughly these approaches remove the target concept from the model.

We begin by proposing **two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models**: (i) interfering with the model's internal guidance processes, and (ii) reducing the unconditional likelihood of generating the target concept, potentially removing it entirely.

To assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce **a comprehensive suite of independent probing techniques**: supplying visual context, modifying the diffusion trajectory, applying classifier guidance, and analyzing the model's alternative generations that emerge in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the value of exploring concept erasure robustness outside of adversarial text inputs, and emphasize the importance of comprehensive evaluations for erasure in diffusion models.

## Environment Setup

Create and activate the provided Conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinlu4588/WhenAreConceptsErased.git
cd cd WhenAreConceptsErased
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Demo

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the demo script:

```bash
cd src
python demo.py
```

This will:
1. Run all available probes on the configured model(s)
2. Save generated images under `data/results/`
3. Automatically compute evaluation metrics (CLIP similarity and classification accuracy)


## Running Probes on Your Model

To run the probes on your own model:

```bash
cd src
python runner.py --concept <your_concept> --pipeline_path <path_to_your_model>
```

For example:
```bash
python runner.py --concept airliner --pipeline_path kevinlu4588/esd-x-airliner
```

This will run all probes by default. You can also specify individual probes:
```bash
python runner.py --concept airliner --pipeline_path <model_path> --probes standardpromptprobe noisebasedprobe
```

## Training new latent classifiers

**Quick start**:

  ```bash
  cd classifier_guidance
  
  python e2e_concept_classifier.py "church, church building" "airliner"\
    --epochs 70 --batch-size 8 --output-dir "./my_classifiers"
  ```
